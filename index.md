I am a third year Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at Florida State University. 

My primary research interests are in the economics of education, labor economics, and public economics. 

Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I was a Research Aide at Cornell University and Assistant Data Editor for the American Economic Association. I received a M.A. (2019) and B.A. (2016) in Economics from the University of New Hampshire.
